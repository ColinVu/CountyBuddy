# County Buddy - A Spatial Dataset of Outliers in Prisons, Universities, Military Bases, and Reservations

A dataset of the presence, number of, and institution names of special populations at the U.S. county and census tract level. The objective of this dataset is provide context to bolster narratives about socio-economic indicators, provide a potential ‘explainer’ for why these values appear, or provide a landscape for situating these values.

The data can be used by researchers and developers who are studying causality and correlation in health and livelihood outcomes, as they can be easily integrated into statistical models (e.g., in R or STATA). They can also be used by developers looking to enhance their maps of U.S. thematic data (life expectancy, percent smokers, car accidents, number of people on Medicare) with tooltips and extra features.
